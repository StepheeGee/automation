### Overview

**DevOps** is a set of practices that aims to automate and streamline the processes of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It focuses on improving collaboration and communication between development teams and operations teams to enhance the efficiency and quality of software delivery. DevOps involves the integration of tools, processes, and cultural philosophies to achieve continuous development, continuous testing, continuous deployment, and continuous monitoring.

**In this project**, we explore the use of **DevOps** in automation.
